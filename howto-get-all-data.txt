I) Locations
    - download manually the info from
        https://www.berlinale.de/de/service/lageplan.html
        https://www.berlinale.de/de/service/lageplan.html?cat=venues
- put data to .../resources/data/locations.json

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

II) Program

1) Download all HTML-pages manually in the browser from https://www.berlinale.de/de/programm/berlinale-programm.html

2) The HTML file's text is in only line. With grep -oP 'https?://[^\s]+' filename.txt you can grep the urls from
it, as -o "Outputs only the matching parts of the lines."

for f in *.html; do grep -oP 'https?://[^\s]+' $f ; done > urls
sort urls > urls1
uniq urls1 > urls2

3) URLs might contain a "&amp" - but freedownloadmanager does not accept that
replace "&amp" by "&" in a text editor

4) Sort out any non ICAL-file URLS manually from urls2

5) Add this file to freedownloadmanager. Downloads all ICAL files,but with ending .html -> manually
correct filenames to .ics

6) cut the VCALENDAR header and footer, only keep the VEVENT part as follows:

a) cat > vcalendarDelete.sh
tail -n +5 $1 | head -n -1
EOF

b) delete all blanks in the ics filenames (eg with Totalcommander)

c) find . -name "*.ics" | xargs -i ./vcalendarDelete.sh {} > result1.txt

d) add header
cat > header.txt
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
CALSCALE:GREGORIAN
METHOD:PUBLISH
PRODID:-//www.berlinale.de//NONSGML iCalcreator 2.6//
VERSION:2.0
X-WR-TIMEZONE:Europe/Berlin
SUMMARY:75. Berlinale
URL:https://www.berlinale.de/
DESCRIPTION:75. Berlinale
EOF

e) add footer
cat > footer.txt
END:VCALENDAR
EOF

f) manually correct result1.txt: URLs might go over 2 lines, needs to get corrected manually.
Find all lines where the first character(s) are blank: Delete starting blanks and move url into one line

g) cat header.txt result1.txt footer.txt > result.txt

h) Final result is in result.txt. Rename to program.ics

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

III) Sources:
- Check the MovieCategory enum
- Change the start and end dates in the application.properties

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV) Test the ics file - use the ProgramParserTest to see if the file can be loaded and all events are there
Note: Format still seem ok with more than 75 characters are in one line?!

a) grep "BEGIN:VEVENT" | wc -l on the file to grep the number of evens

b) Use IcsFileCleaner to glue all description multiline lines to one line.

b) correct ProgramParserTest asserts to new year

c) If ical4j errors in the form
net.fortuna.ical4j.data.ParserException: Error at line 8.946:Invalid factory key: [ ]
come up, then the line number of the ics file is given (here: number 8946).
-> Typically the parser cannot cope with DESCRIPTION texts which are multiline texts. In the lines 2,3, ...
the text starts with a blank. If the following character is a : or a = , this will fail -> manually correct
-> might be away because of b)

d) Also, SUMMARY over two lines does not work properly: The URL on the next line is than added to the Summary
-> Runtime problems, where the link is not show in the film list and the prio 50 is the link. -> manually correct,
-> correct IcsFileCleaner for that

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V) Add missing locations manually (any Kino with prefix like "Cubix" for "Cubix 1,2,3..." is done automatically
but some Kinos are missing on the locations list or written differently.
